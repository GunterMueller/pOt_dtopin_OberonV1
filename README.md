# Portable Oberon Translator

This is a good old project --- I took Niklaus Wirth's source
code of the original Oberon compiler, and replaced everything
but the parser to produce ANSI C code instead. The compiler
compiles fast, and the code runs fast. C standalone programs
even have mark and sweep garbage collector!

Last change was made in 1994. Enjoy.
